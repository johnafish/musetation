# musetation

Musetation (mews-tay-shun) is a web application that connects with a muse (http://meetmuse.com) to bring you more efficient meditation through the science of binaural beats.

Brought to you by @johnafish and @foleyfactor for the Waterloo 2015 tech retreat hackathon.

To experience musetation:
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.3+, and you have installed the python-osc library. This can be done with pip install python-osc.
2. Have your muse connect to port 1337 on your computer. Open index.html, and configure the beats to the frequency and volume of your preference, then click Start.
3. Run the file "museInterface.py", and click Start. This file monitors your brainwave data. Once you are done your session, click End and the interface should exit.
4. Click End on the index.html page. This should take you to a page where you can see how efficient your meditation session was.
